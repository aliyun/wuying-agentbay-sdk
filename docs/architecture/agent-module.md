# Agent Module Architecture

The Agent module is a core component of the AgentBay SDK that provides AI-powered capabilities for executing tasks, checking task status, and terminating tasks within a cloud session. This document details the architecture, design patterns, and implementation specifics of the Agent module across all supported languages.

## Overview

The Agent module enables natural language task execution within cloud sessions, allowing developers to instruct the system to perform complex operations using human-readable descriptions. The module abstracts the complexity of AI task orchestration behind a simple API.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Class/Struct
The main interface for AI-powered operations within a session context.

### 2. ExecutionResult
Represents the result of task execution operations, containing success status, task ID, task status, and error information.

### 3. QueryResult
Represents the result of query operations, containing success status, output data, and error information.

## Architectural Patterns

### Session-Coupled Design
The Agent module follows a session-coupled design pattern where:
- Each Agent instance is bound to a specific Session
- Agent operations execute within the context of its parent Session
- Resource lifecycle is managed through the parent Session

### Task Orchestration Pattern
The Agent module implements a task orchestration pattern that:
- Accepts natural language task descriptions
- Translates tasks into actionable operations
- Monitors task execution status
- Provides mechanisms for task termination

### Polling Mechanism
For long-running tasks, the Agent module implements a polling mechanism that:
- Initiates task execution through MCP tool calls
- Periodically checks task status
- Handles task completion, failure, and timeout scenarios
- Provides configurable retry limits

## Language Implementations

### Python
- Object-oriented design with classes and methods
- Synchronous execution with built-in retry logic
- JSON parsing for response handling
- Exception handling with custom AgentError types

### Golang
- Struct-based design with receiver methods
- Explicit error handling with detailed error messages
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling for response processing
- Pointer-based return types for result objects

### TypeScript
- Class-based architecture with async/await patterns
- Promise-based asynchronous operations
- JSON parsing with error handling
- Strong typing with TypeScript interfaces

## Data Flow

1. **Task Initiation**: Developer calls `execute_task` with a natural language description
2. **MCP Tool Invocation**: Agent translates the task into an MCP tool call
3. **Task ID Generation**: System returns a task ID for tracking
4. **Status Polling**: Agent polls for task completion using `get_task_status`
5. **Result Processing**: Final task status is returned to the developer
6. **Task Termination**: Developer can terminate running tasks using `terminate_task`

## Error Handling

The Agent module implements comprehensive error handling:
- Structured result objects with success status
- Detailed error messages for different failure scenarios
- Request ID tracking for debugging purposes
- Timeout handling for long-running operations
- Graceful degradation for unsupported tasks

## Integration Points

### MCP Tool Integration
The Agent module integrates with MCP tools for task execution:
- `flux_execute_task`: Initiates task execution
- `flux_get_task_status`: Retrieves task status
- `flux_terminate_task`: Terminates running tasks

### Session Integration
The Agent module is tightly integrated with Session management:
- Access to session context for task execution
- Session-based authentication for MCP tool calls
- Lifecycle management through parent Session

## Performance Considerations

- Configurable polling intervals to balance responsiveness and resource usage
- Retry limits to prevent infinite polling loops
- Efficient JSON parsing for response handling
- Connection reuse for MCP tool calls

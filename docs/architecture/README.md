# AgentBay SDK Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AgentBay SDK architecture, detailing the core components, their interactions, and the overall design principles that guide the implementation across all supported languages (Python, TypeScript, and Golang).

## Overview

The AgentBay SDK follows a modular, service-oriented architecture that enables developers to interact with the AgentBay cloud environment through intuitive APIs. The architecture is designed to provide consistent functionality across all supported languages while adhering to language-specific idioms and conventions.

## Core Components

### 1. AgentBay (Client)
The main entry point for the SDK that provides access to global services and session management.

### 2. Session
Represents a session in the AgentBay cloud environment, providing isolated execution contexts with access to various capabilities:

- **FileSystem**: File and directory operations
- **Command**: Shell command execution
- **Code**: Code execution in multiple languages
- **UI**: User interface interaction
- **Window**: Window management
- **Application**: Application lifecycle management
- **OSS**: Object Storage Service integration
- **Context**: Context management within a session
- **Browser**: Browser automation capabilities (Python/TypeScript only)

### 3. ContextService
Manages persistent contexts that can be synchronized across sessions for data persistence.

### 4. ContextManager
Manages contexts within a specific session, enabling synchronization and interaction with persistent contexts.

## Architectural Patterns

### Client-Service Architecture
The SDK follows a client-service pattern where:
- The `AgentBay` client serves as the primary interface
- Each session provides access to various service modules
- Services are loosely coupled and can be used independently

### Context Synchronization
The SDK implements a sophisticated context synchronization mechanism that allows:
- Mounting persistent contexts at specific paths within sessions
- Configurable synchronization policies for upload/download operations
- Automatic synchronization during session creation and deletion
- Browser context specialization for web automation workflows

### Browser Automation
Specialized browser automation capabilities are available in Python and TypeScript SDKs:
- AIBrowser integration for web interactions
- Playwright compatibility for advanced browser control
- Browser context persistence across sessions
- AI-assisted browser operations (act, observe, extract)

## Language Implementations

While maintaining consistent APIs across languages, each implementation follows language-specific conventions:

### Python
- Object-oriented design with classes and methods
- Context managers for resource management
- Type hints for improved developer experience

### TypeScript
- Class-based architecture with async/await patterns
- Strong typing with TypeScript interfaces
- Modern JavaScript ecosystem integration

### Golang
- Struct-based design with receiver methods
- Explicit error handling
- Idiomatic Go patterns and conventions

## Data Flow

1. **Initialization**: Developer initializes the `AgentBay` client with API credentials
2. **Session Creation**: Client creates a session in the cloud environment
3. **Capability Access**: Session provides access to various service modules
4. **Operation Execution**: Service modules execute operations in the cloud
5. **Result Handling**: Results are returned to the developer through structured response objects
6. **Session Cleanup**: Sessions are deleted when no longer needed

## Error Handling

The SDK implements consistent error handling patterns:
- Structured result objects with success status
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Request ID tracking for support purposes
- Automatic retry mechanisms for transient failures

## Security

- API key authentication
- Secure communication channels
- Input validation and sanitization
- Principle of least privilege

## Performance Considerations

- Connection pooling for efficient resource usage
- Asynchronous operations where applicable
- Context synchronization optimization
- Pagination for large dataset handling

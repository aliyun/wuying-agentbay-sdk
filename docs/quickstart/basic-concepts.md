# Core Concepts

Before we start programming, let's understand the essential concepts you need to know to use AgentBay effectively.

## üåê What is AgentBay?

AgentBay is a cloud computing platform that provides on-demand virtual environments. You can think of it as:
- Cloud-based remote computers that support different operating systems (Windows, Linux, Android)
- Virtual machines that can be created and destroyed instantly
- Designed specifically for automation, testing, and development tasks

### üì¶ AgentBay Class - Your Cloud Gateway

In the SDK, the `AgentBay` class is your main interface for interacting with the cloud service:

```python
from agentbay import AgentBay

# Create AgentBay client instance
agent_bay = AgentBay()
```

**Core functions of the AgentBay class:**
- **Session Manager**: Create, delete, and manage cloud sessions
- **API Client**: Handle all communication with AgentBay cloud service
- **Authentication Handler**: Automatically manage API keys and security

**Basic usage pattern:**
```python
# 1. Initialize client
agent_bay = AgentBay()

# 2. Create session (uses linux_latest by default)
session = agent_bay.create().session

# 3. Use session for your tasks
# ... your automation tasks ...

# 4. Clean up resources
agent_bay.delete(session)
```

## üîó Session

A **session** is your connection to a cloud environment. It's like renting a computer in the cloud for a specific period of time.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Temporary**: Sessions are created when you need them and destroyed when you're done
- **Isolated**: Each session is completely separate from others
- **Billable**: You pay for the time your session is active

### Basic Usage:
```python
# Create a session
session = agent_bay.create().session

# Use the session for your tasks
session.command.execute_command("echo 'Hello World'")

# Always clean up when done
agent_bay.delete(session)
```

### Session Lifecycle:
```
Create Session ‚Üí Use Session ‚Üí Delete Session
      ‚Üì             ‚Üì              ‚Üì
  Allocate      Execute         Release
  Resources     Operations      Resources
```

### Session Release

Sessions must be released when you're done to free cloud resources. There are **two ways** to release a session:

**1. Manual Release (Recommended)**
```python
# Explicitly delete when done
agent_bay.delete(session)
```

**2. Automatic Timeout Release**
- If not manually deleted, sessions are automatically released after a timeout period
- Timeout duration is configured in the [AgentBay Console](https://agentbay.console.aliyun.com/)
- After timeout, the session is released and cannot be recovered

**Important**: Always manually delete sessions when finished. This is a best practice for resource management.

## üñ•Ô∏è Image Types

When creating a session, you must choose an **image type** - this determines what kind of environment you get and what you can do with it.

### Official System Images:

The following table shows the latest official system images provided by AgentBay:

| Image ID | Environment | Best For |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `linux_latest` | Computer Use | General computing, server tasks (default if not specified) |
| `windows_latest` | Computer Use | General Windows tasks, .NET development, Windows apps |
| `browser_latest` | Browser Use | Web scraping, browser automation, testing websites |
| `code_latest` | CodeSpace  | Coding, development tools, programming tasks |
| `mobile_latest` | Mobile Use | Mobile app testing, Android automation |

**Note**:
- If you don't specify an `image_id`, AgentBay will automatically use `linux_latest` as the default environment.
- These are the current latest versions of official system images. You can also create and use **custom images** through the AgentBay console to meet your specific requirements.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Production Environment Recommendation**:
- The `xxx_latest` images are automatically updated to newer versions, which may introduce API incompatibilities with older SDK versions.
- **For production environments**, it is strongly recommended to use **custom images** with fixed versions to ensure stability and avoid unexpected breaking changes.
- Custom images can be created and managed through the [AgentBay Console](https://agentbay.console.aliyun.com/), allowing you to control exactly which version of the environment your application uses.

### Choosing the Right Image:

**Windows Environment Example:**
```python
from agentbay.session_params import CreateSessionParams

# Create Windows environment and automate notepad
params = CreateSessionParams(image_id="windows_latest")
session = agent_bay.create(params).session

# Start Notepad application
session.computer.start_app("notepad.exe")
# Returns: ProcessListResult with started process info

# Input text into notepad
session.computer.input_text("Hello from Windows!")
# Returns: BoolResult with success status

agent_bay.delete(session)
```

**Browser Environment Example:**
```python
# Create browser environment
params = CreateSessionParams(image_id="browser_latest")
session = agent_bay.create(params).session

# Initialize and navigate
from agentbay.browser import BrowserOption
session.browser.initialize(BrowserOption())
session.browser.agent.navigate("https://www.baidu.com")
print("Web navigation successful")

agent_bay.delete(session)
```

**CodeSpace Environment Example:**
```python
# Create development environment and execute code
params = CreateSessionParams(image_id="code_latest")
session = agent_bay.create(params).session

# Execute code
result = session.code.run_code("print('Hello from CodeSpace!')", "python")
# Returns: CodeExecutionResult with output
# Example: result.result = "Hello from CodeSpace!"

agent_bay.delete(session)
```

**Mobile Environment Example:**
```python
# Create Android environment and send HOME key
params = CreateSessionParams(image_id="mobile_latest")
session = agent_bay.create(params).session

# Press HOME key to return to home screen
from agentbay.mobile import KeyCode
session.mobile.send_key(KeyCode.HOME)
# Returns: BoolResult with success status
# Example: result.success = True (returns to Android home screen)

agent_bay.delete(session)
```

**Important**: Different images support different features. Choose the image that matches your specific use case.

## üíæ Data Permanence - Temporary vs Persistent

Understanding data permanence is crucial when using cloud environments:

### Temporary Data (Default Behavior)
- **All data in a session is temporary by default**
- **Everything is lost when the session ends**
- Suitable for: processing tasks, temporary files, cache

```python
# This data will be LOST when session ends
session.file_system.write_file("/tmp/temp_data.txt", "This will disappear")
```

### Persistent Data (Context)
- **Data that survives across sessions**
- **Must be explicitly configured**
- Suitable for: project files, configurations, important results

```python
from agentbay import ContextSync

# Create persistent storage
context = agent_bay.context.get("my-project", create=True).context
context_sync = ContextSync.new(context.id, "/persistent")

# Create session with persistent data
params = CreateSessionParams(context_syncs=[context_sync])
session = agent_bay.create(params).session

# This data will be SAVED across sessions
session.file_system.write_file("/persistent/important.txt", "This will persist")
```

**Critical Rule**: If you need to keep data, you MUST use Context. Otherwise, it will be lost forever when the session ends.

## üîç Understanding API Results and Request IDs

When you call AgentBay APIs, the results are wrapped in result objects that contain more than just your data:

```python
# Example API call
screenshot = session.computer.screenshot()

# The result object contains:
print(screenshot.success)     # True/False - whether the operation succeeded
print(screenshot.data)        # Your actual data (screenshot URL)
print(screenshot.request_id)  # Request ID for troubleshooting
```

### What is a Request ID?
Every API call to AgentBay gets a unique **Request ID** - a special identifier like `"ABC12345-XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ-123456789ABC"`.

**Why Request IDs matter:**
- **Troubleshooting**: If something goes wrong, you can provide this ID to support for faster problem resolution
- **Tracking**: Helps track individual operations in logs
- **Debugging**: Makes it easier to identify which specific API call had issues

**When you might need it:**
- API calls fail unexpectedly
- Performance issues with specific operations
- When contacting support about problems

**Example troubleshooting:**
```python
result = session.code.run_code("print('hello')", "python")
if not result.success:
    print(f"Code execution failed! Request ID: {result.request_id}")
    # Share this Request ID with support for faster help
```

Don't worry about Request IDs for normal usage - they're just there when you need them for debugging!

# Agent Modules

## ü§ñ Agent Module Overview

Agent modules are specialized AI task execution units
runnning in Agentbay windows environment to execute tasks decribed in natural language. 
The task to be executed can be as simple as "Create a word document, input some words and save the document.", in which only one application is involved, or as complex as "Find out the current weather in New York City by Google/Baidu, and write the weather report to a word document, send the word document to a specific email address", in which multiple applications are involved.

The agent is capable of understanding user instructions, planning task execution steps, operating various applications, and managing files and folders on the computer.

## System Image Support

Agent Module functionality is currently only available on specific system images:

| System Image | Agent Module Support | Available APIs |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|
| `windows_latest` | ‚úÖ Supported | `execute_task`, `get_task_status`, `terminate_task` |
| `linux_latest` | ‚ùå Not Supported | - |
| `browser_latest` | ‚ùå Not Supported | - |
| `code_latest` | ‚ùå Not Supported | - |
| `mobile_latest` | ‚ùå Not Supported | - |

**Important:** When using Agent Module features, you must create sessions with `image_id="windows_latest"` to ensure the required MCP tools are available.

## Creating Agent Sessions

```python
from agentbay import AgentBay, CreateSessionParams

agent_bay = AgentBay()

# Create a session for Agent module usage
agent_params = CreateSessionParams(
    image_id="windows_latest",
    labels={"project": "ai-agent"}
)

result = agent_bay.create(agent_params)
if result.success:
    agent_session = result.session
    print(f"Session created with ID: {agent_session.session_id}")
else:
    print(f"Session creation failed: {result.error_message}")
```

## Agent Capabilities
- Office Automation: Word/Excel/PowerPoint automation
- File Operations:Create/Delete/Move/Copy files and folders
- Infomation Processing: 
    - Gather information from webpages
    - Extract information from a web page
    - Fill forms in a web page
- Text Edition: Using notepad to edit(Read/Write/Edit) text file

### Task Execution
```python
# Execute a task using natural language
task_description = "Calculate the square root of 144"
execution_result = agent_session.agent.execute_task(task_description, max_try_times=5)

if execution_result.success:
    print("Task completed successfully!")
    print(f"Task ID: {execution_result.task_id}")
    print(f"Task status: {execution_result.task_status}")
else:
    print(f"Task failed: {execution_result.error_message}")
```

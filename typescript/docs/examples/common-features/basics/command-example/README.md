# Command Execution Example

This example demonstrates how to use the command execution features of the AgentBay SDK for TypeScript.

## Features Demonstrated

- Executing shell commands
- Setting custom timeouts for commands
- Running Python code
- Running JavaScript code
- Executing multi-line command sequences

## Running the Example

1. Make sure you have installed the AgentBay SDK:

```bash
npm install wuying-agentbay-sdk
```

2. Set your API key as an environment variable (recommended):

```bash
export AGENTBAY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Compile and run the example:

```bash
# Compile TypeScript
cd command-example
npx ts-node command-example.ts
```

## Code Explanation

The example demonstrates different ways to execute commands:

1. Basic shell command execution
2. Command execution with custom timeout
3. Running Python code
4. Running JavaScript code with custom timeout
5. Executing a multi-line shell command sequence

The code also demonstrates proper error handling and resource cleanup using try-finally.

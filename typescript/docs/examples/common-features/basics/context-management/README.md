# Context Management Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Context Management features of the AgentBay SDK for TypeScript.

## Features Demonstrated

- Listing all contexts
- Getting or creating a context
- Creating a session with a context
- Updating a context
- Clearing context data (synchronous clear)
- Deleting a context

## Running the Example

1. Make sure you have installed the AgentBay SDK:

```bash
npm install wuying-agentbay-sdk
```

2. Set your API key as an environment variable (recommended):

```bash
export AGENTBAY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Compile and run the example:

```bash
# Compile TypeScript
cd context-management
npx ts-node context-management.ts
```

## Code Explanation

The example demonstrates a full lifecycle of context management:

1. Initialize the AgentBay client with an API key
2. List all existing contexts to see what's available
3. Get an existing context by name, or create it if it doesn't exist
4. Create a session using the context
5. Update the context's properties
6. Clear the context's persistent data (demonstrates synchronous clear method)
7. Clean up by deleting the session and context

Context management allows you to work with persistent storage areas that can be used across multiple sessions. This enables scenarios like:

- Preserving file system changes between sessions
- Maintaining application state across session restarts
- Sharing data between different sessions
- Creating templates for quick session initialization

# Context Management Example

This example demonstrates how to manage contexts using the Wuying AgentBay SDK. It covers:

- Initializing the AgentBay client
- Listing all contexts
- Getting a context (creating if it doesn't exist)
- Creating a session with a context
- Updating a context
- Deleting a context

This example is useful for understanding how to use contexts to organize and manage sessions.

## Running the Example

```bash
cd context_management
python main.py
```

Make sure you have set the `AGENTBAY_API_KEY` environment variable or replace the placeholder in the code with your actual API key.

# Application and Window Management Example

This example demonstrates how to use the application and window management features of the Wuying AgentBay SDK. It covers:

- Initializing the AgentBay client
- Creating a session
- Getting installed applications
- Listing visible applications
- Listing root windows
- Getting the active window
- Window operations (activate, maximize, minimize, restore, resize)
- Focus mode
- Deleting a session

This example is useful for understanding how to interact with applications and windows in the operating system.

## Running the Example

```bash
cd application_window
go run main.go
```

Make sure you have set the `AGENTBAY_API_KEY` environment variable or replace the placeholder in the code with your actual API key.
